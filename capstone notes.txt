TO SET UP PYTHON venv

Install Python if not already installed.
Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv.
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies as needed using pip.
Freeze dependencies to requirements.txt if necessary.
Deactivate with deactivate when finished.


dependencies
    numpy   -- math library
    pandas  -- relational dataframe library for data handling
    python-dotenv -- loads environment variables from the .environment
    requests -- handles api call and response from TIINGO
    




API Selection
    # was getting an error from the yahoo example from pandas_datareader
        AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
    # found this SO from a couple months ago which suggests yfinance as an alternative-- (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78343119/how-to-implement-web-datareader-correctly)
        # yfinance repo -- (https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance)
    
Project steps:
    1. Identify and test an API to retrieve stock data from 2006 thru 2016
        - yahoo with pandas_datareader not wokrking
        - yfinance seems to have promise
        - finally had to settle on Tiingo and not using pandas_datareader. Rather, I used requests to connect to Tiingo REST API.

    2. scrape the data into a local file so I do not need to make an API call for each run
        - used the json library to collect API response and parse into json files which can be loaded into a pandas df.
            -- looking at the data, there are no nested columns in the return data (1 column with 1 value, not an array of values)

    3. aggregate data into a single dataframe called bank_stocks, use the tickers as a key parameter
        - columns have identical names across all retrieved data, so pd.concat should do the trick
